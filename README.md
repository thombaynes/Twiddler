Twiddler files
==============================

This repo contains configuration files for the one handed chording keyboard Twiddler 3.

This was forked from a repository developed by <a href="http://google.com/+AlexBravo">Alex Bravo</a>. He developed the Backspice layout as an improvement of the already great TabSpace layout.

This is maintained for left hand only, as that is what I use with it. You will definitely need to create a mirror layout if you want to use Twiddler with your right hand.
Feel free to submit a pull request if you create such a layout.
